# koko_interface
koko_interface is a Python API that allows users to control a koko robotic arm without directly interfacing with ROS. It uses ROSBridge to communicate with the koko arm's onboard computer. The following files are included in this repository:
  - koko_interface.py: A file containing methods for controlling a koko arm in joint position, joint torque, joint velocity, and cartesian pose control modes
  - rosbridge_client.py: A client that provides basic ROS functionality using rosbridge
  - record_positions_example.py: A Hello World for controlling a koko arm with joint position control
  - record_pose_example.py: A Hello World for controlling a koko arm with carteisian pose control
